### **Purpose**

In recent years, the city of Brisbane has seen the rise of numerous independent craft breweries whose locations range from the inner-city through to the outer-suburbs. Many of these breweries serve as community hubs where people can go to enjoy a locally produced beverage and quite often, purchase culinary offerings from one of the fantastic food trucks that operate in this great city.

A challenge faced by breweries wishing to book a food truck has been the inability for them to instantly view the availability of a truck before making an a booking request directly to business operator. Quite often, this results in a brewery having to contact numerous food truck operators before they find one that is available for a particular day and time.

Customers who wish to know what food truck will be at a particular brewery location at a given date and time can struggle to easily find this information. Usually it is achieved by trawling through the breweries or food truck businesses social media channels in hope that they have posted their upcoming events for the week.

Crafty Tukka is a web application that aims to solve these problems by facilitating bookings between breweries and food truck operators and then displaying them an easy to navigate user interface.

### **Functionality / Features**

Crafty Tukka features 2 types of user accounts that require an initial sign-up and secure login credentials: *Venue and Food Truck*.

Upon creating a new account, both brewery venues and food truck operators will be required to enter general information such as the *business name, description, email and phone number* with an option to include a *website address and social media links*. Unique fields exist for each type of account with breweries being required to provide an address and food trucks a cuisine category. 

Once registered and logged in, a brewery venue will be able to search for food trucks that are available on a given day while having the option to filter the list of food trucks by cuisine type. When the venue has found a food truck that they wish to book, they will be able to send a booking request to the truck operator who will be alerted of the request and then able to either accept or reject the request.
