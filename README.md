### **Purpose**

In recent years, the city of Brisbane has seen the rise of numerous independent craft breweries whose locations range from the inner-city through to the outer-suburbs. Many of these breweries serve as community hubs where people can go to enjoy a locally produced beverage and quite often, purchase culinary offerings from one of the fantastic food trucks that operate in this great city.

A challenge faced by breweries wishing to book a food truck has been the inability for them to instantly view the availability of a truck before making an a booking request directly to business operator. Quite often, this results in a brewery having to contact numerous food truck operators before they find one that is available for a particular day and time.

Customers who wish to know what food truck will be at a particular brewery location at a given date and time can struggle to easily find this information. Usually it is achieved by trawling through the breweries or food truck businesses social media channels in hope that they have posted their upcoming events for the week.

Crafty Tukka is a web application that connects breweries, food trucks and those who enjoy their products. It achieves this by allowing breweries and food trucks to request and confirm bookings. Once finalised, the booking is then made available to view by general users of the application.
